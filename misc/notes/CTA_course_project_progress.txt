Stacking Emission Line and Continuum Images from SITELLE Data Cubes

The goal of this project is to produce a pipeline to create stacked images using 3D data cube of imaging-spectroscopic data from the Fourier Transform spectrograph SITELLE at CFHT which produces data equivalent to a very large field-of-view IFU. The student will use the data from cluster  galaxies in both continuum and emission line (H-alpha, [NII]6548, and [NII]6583) from emission line galaxies (ELGs) that have already been identified in a clusters at z~0.23. The goal is to produce stacked images in both emission line and continuum for the faint cluster galaxies in the sample, which will allow the student to measure the average profile and size of the star-formation regions of ELGs with low surface brightness emission line features.

1. Science
----------
 Satellite galaxies falling into the gravitational potential of a galaxy cluster undergo environmental quenching processes, which halt star-formation in the in-falling galaxy. Current studies indicate this process is rapid, beginning during the initial in-fall and interaction with the intra-cluster medium (ICM), a hot gas which dominates the baryonic matter of a galaxy cluster. The interaction between an in-falling galaxy and the ICM can result in a process called Ram-Pressure Stripping, where the hot ICM interacts with the star-forming gas of the galaxy. This heats the gas and strips it from the gravitational potential of the galaxy. As stars and dark matter are non-collisional, RPS does not affect the distribution of this material. So, RPS disturbs the star-forming gas and modifies the morphology of the ionized gas profile, which is traced by the H-alpha emission line.
 We seek to understand how the process of RPS affects galaxies at all stages of in-fall, and at low masses. However, low mass galaxies, like many cluster satellites, are often faint. By stacking these galaxies, lower surface brightness features and extended profiles can be measured. By comparing the average surface profiles and sizes of ELGs in different regions of the cluster phase space, we can gain insights into how the quenching of star formation proceeds as galaxies in-fall into the cluster; e.g., whether the quenching of star formation is from inside-out or out-side in. providing constraints on the types of quenching mechanisms in operation. The data from the stacked images will allow us to push this analysis to the fainter low-mass in-falling galaxies.


2. Using the SITELLE data cubes and becoming familiar with redshift, wavelength, and wavenumber
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 2.1. Using a table of known ELG physical positions within the cube and measured redshifts, the student will identify which data cube "channels" (the 3rd dimension of the data cube) are associated with emission lines vs. the continuum. 
	This can be gathered from Qing's code.
	COMPLETE? I have A2390 in a catalogue.

To do this, the student must determine the redshifted wavelength of the H-alpha and [NII] emission lines and estimate a width of the lines. 
	This will be done to split the total measurement into emission and continuum (continuum being defined by all that is not encompassed by the emission lines. Emission lines must have continuum estimate subtracted before analysis)
	The whole point of the analysis is ot do this division.

The student will then convert the wavelengths into wavenumbers, which is the unit in which SITELLE stores its 3rd dimension of the data cubes. 
	Look up wavenumbers. This isn't particularily difficult. Likely could simply modify the catalogues to use wavenumbers, or can be handled in pipeline. Maybe there should be an optional argument for wavelengths.

The student will then determine the wavenumber positions of the continuum, which will not be associated with noise or emission line wavenumbers. 

Include a sample calculation for a single galaxy in the writeup.


 2.2. Once the channels associated with emission lines and continuum are determined, add the channels associated with H-alpha, [NII]6548, and [NII]6583 separately in an area around the ELGs position to create a single fits image of each emission line profile. 
	How do we determine size of image? Do we simply take x pixels in each cardinal direction from the centroid? That's easy enough
	WE HAVE TO REVERSE THE X AND THE Y
	The problem is that I'm not sure how to pull pixels directly from the cubes. We would need to, I assume, pass in the x/y location and the wavenumber we need so it should be simple

Do the same with the continuum channels to create a single continuum fits image of the ELG. Perform this with all identified candidate ELGs.
	

 2.3. Create pdf images using matplotlib's imshow() function of each emission line image and the continuum image of each ELG. 
	
In the writeup, include one pdf image of the most visually striking emission line and continuum in the studentâ€™s opinion.
	How I shall determine this will come up later once I've seen some of the images. I would however like to quantitatively decide, but that may not be necessary.

3. Stacking the ELGs
--------------------
 3.1. Once all fits emission line and continuum images have been made, stacks of these images will be created. The first step is to establish the criteria for selecting the sample(s) of galaxies to be stacked (e.g., brightness range, position). 
	Criteria should be entirely quantitative or else the galaxies could have been cherry-picked. Ideally, the criteria should even be decided before the images are seen, as to prevent interference of that manner. I could always reconsider.

There are a few ways to create stacks, and exploration of the best method will be performed by the student:
   3.1.1. Perform a simple sum of the images using numpy's sum() functionality, making sure that the proper centroids for the images being stacked are used. The background should have a flux of zero, with noise.
   3.1.2. Perform a median stack by determining the median flux value at each pixel in a stack of emission lines or continuum.
   3.1.3. Perform an average stack by dividing the summed stack by the number of galaxies in each stack of emission lines and continuum.
   3.1.4. Perform a mode stack by determining the mode flux value (most common flux value) at each pixel for each stack.
		I would like to try and implement multiple, if not all. I will start however with 3.1.3 because I believe it is the simplest. From there I can decide what method will help the most.

 3.2. Use matplotlib's imshow() function to display each type of stack in Hydrogen alpha, the [NII] emission lines, and the continuum image.
 3.3. Analyze the differences between each type of stack, establish objective criteria to determine which method produces the best result. Discuss the benefits or drawbacks of utilizing each type of stack for a size analysis.

4. Size analysis (Optional: only if time allows) 
-----------------------------------------------
	I will try my best to do this as well. This seemse extremely important, and if I can get a good size identifier then it opens so many doors for future investigation.

  4.1. Create a curve of growth image of what the student determines is the most reliable stack type. Sum the flux values in increasing circular apertures from the center of the galaxy stacks, until an asymptote or leveling off of flux is found. Do this for each emission line stack and the continuum. Create a plot of distance from the center of the stack vs summed flux internal to that distance, or the curve of growth.
  4.2. Determine the value of the asymptotic flux. From this value, determine the location of the half-light position, or radius, for each stack. This half-light radius will be the position where the flux internal to the aperture is half the value of the asymptotic flux.
  4.3. Plot an image of each stack with a circle overlaid, denoting the half-light radial size of each stack.
  4.4. Determine the physical size of the half light radius of each stack: use astropy.cosmology() to convert the size in arcseconds to a size in kiloparsecs. Make use of astropy.units() and astropy.constants() if needed to determine physical sizes. Assume a flat Lambda CDM cosmology with Omega_matter=0.3, Omega_lambda=0.7, and a Hubble constant of 70 km/s/Mpc. See astropy documentation of the cosmology functions for details.
