Correction factor for curves of growth for half light radius. Determine full light radius from previous system, then go to a good curve of growth and determine what percentage of the real full light it has at that radius. Use this factor to estimate the real full light radius by multiplying.(if the full light radius is measured at 12pix, go to the good image and determine that, for example, it needs to be multiplied by 1.1 to get the full light. Then go back to the original full light radius and multiply by that 1.1 factor. Get half light radius from there.
