fits.writeto(directory+nameofobject, image, overwrite=True)
	Makes a .fits cutout

	Makes better images with imshow use normalized images.ImageNormalize object
	

Set different colouring patterns for emission vs continuum

How will we determine brightness? We only will stack the faint objects.
	-EW (top plot)
	-S/N (bottom plot)
	-Flux (top plot green line) perhaps the median flux, just like in the image

ISO_source_detection is where we want to look for source extractor stuff to cut out peripheral objects
	There is a segmentation map that we can steal

While masking use nansum and set stuff to nan
