Try stacking with top quarter/second quarter of emission brightness to see if there's a problem

!!!Fix the mistake with how the arrays work for subtracting the continuum median!!!

"Normalize the channels" otherwise goofy results ensue. Normalization is needed
	Normalize the spectrum. pixel's flux needs to be normalized 0-1. I don't understand

The stacks need to have the redshfits, shifted, so that everything is cenetered properly
	We need to "de-redshift". I don't understand

Maybe create images by mean instead of sum perhaps???

Measure signal-to-noise???
